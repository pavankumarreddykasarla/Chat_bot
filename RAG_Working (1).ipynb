been for several days, somewhat skeptical as to the genuine ness of the find. as the hours pass on the latter opinion grows stronger. many miners who started when the first news of the dis covery of gold in extraordinary quantities was brought north, and who were delayed and charged exorbitant duties on every ar ticle they had in their possession before they were permitted to cross the border and pro ceed to the gulches, are returning sick, sore, penniless and disgusted. almost all of them came back with a theory. this theory is that the whole exc ite ment was brought about by an adroitly en

succeed very we'll. the scenes are the same those that have characterized every new mining camp for years. there are just as many fights, just as much shooting and just much general cussedness as there evrr was. the tough people who go there take the guns away from the soldiers ani crack them over the head with the butts if they protest. a man named perkins, an experienced miner ant a man of

increased risks have rendered good management necessary. the time has come when every occu patton on farm must be managed with judgment and skill in order to make it profitable. there is sharp competition in every department of ! farming and stock raising as there is in every department of trade and manu featuring. not many years ago there was profit in producing pork almost anywhere or in any way that the busi ness was conducted. corn was abun dant and cheap, while live and dressed hogs brought at least a fair price. ! less risk attended keeping hogs than ! any kind of farm animals, as there were few instances of contagious dis eases among them. as such was the case forehanded farmers would sometimes keep hogs until they were two or three years old if the price of pork was not what they thought it should be. in the timbered regions of the south hogs were allowed to roam in the woods and to subsist on mast till they had attained large size. they were as hardy as wild beasts, and some of them were almost as fierce. the cost of raising them was little more than nominal, as they had no roof to cover them and they were not kept in an inclosure. not many years ago a large number of persons made money by buying lean hogs from farmers and others who h ad no means of feeding them and fatten ing them on grain they parched. in the south some man in nearly every village made practice of buying lean hogs from blacks and poor whites. and also buying fields of lodged grain and corn, into which they turned the hogs. by taking this course they saved ! the expense of harvesting the crops and they claimed that but little of the grain was wasted. many people in the west made large profits in buying store hogs and ! feeding them on corn and small grain that was not up to the standard the market required. not few made money by feeding merchantable corn to such hogs. some claimed that there was a profit in raising pigs from the , time they were weaned till they were prepared to slaughter on corn bought at the usual market price. they found that they could make ten pounds of pork from a bushel of corn. the cost of taking care of the hogs during the fattening periods was small and the losses among them very few. but pork raising is no longer the profitable business it was few years ago. the difference between the price of corn and that of pork that it makes is not as large. during some seasons i the corn is worth as much as the pork that can be made from it. the difference in the cost ! of transporting the two articles has become less. in the meantime the risk in keeping hogs has greatly increased. the swine plague, which is generally fatal in its results, has be come epidemic. in places where the disease breaks out the soil appears to disease amount to millions nearly every year. many farmers have suf fered so heavily that they have given up raising hogs for the market pork production has ceased to be profit able industry in many parts of the ! west where corn is the leading crop. few persons are willing to engage ex tensively in business that involves so great a risk. for many years hogs were regarded as the safest stock that could be kept on the farm. now there is greater risk in keeping hogs than horses. cattle, and sheep, rs tn ey rarely suffer from contagious diseases. most farmers have learned by ex perience that it is not profitable to winter hogs that are not kept for breeding purposes. perhaps the ma jority think it is best to have pigs dropped in march and to dispose of them by the end of the year. by giving them good corn and feed they can be made to weigh from two to three hundred pounds in that time. without expensive buildings and a large amount of corn and hot slops or cooked food hogs will gain but little during the latter part of the winter. dairy farmers generally find pigs profitable, as they consume the sour and skinned milk for which they have no other use. experiments show that hogs can be kept during the summer on clover cheaper than on any kind of food generally given them. the crop needs no cultivation or harvesting, and the only expenses at tending keeping hogs in a clover ! pasture are the seed, the rent of land, and a fence.\n"]}],"source":["node = nodes[1]  # Accessing the second node in the list\n","\n","# Extracting the 'text' attribute of the TextNode within the
